## Layers creation applying CSW-T

HHypermap Registry comes with the ability to create layers giving a CSW transactions. Provisionally we will use the software Paw https://paw.cloud/.

### Using paw in development.

We will use the example files found in the data directory. First, we need to open the project **cswt_paw.paw**. Also, we will use the example catalog *cnp*. Make sure to create the catalog in the database before executing the csw transaction.

**Note.** The first time paw asks for credentials. It is possible to solve it by reset and clear of passphrase.
