{"layer_year":1958, "abstract" : "While English is the official language, it is typically used for governmental, business, and media purposes. In day to day life most people in the country speak Krio, which is a style of Pidgin English or English-based creole language. Krio is the lingua franco for the country and the formal language for those who do not speak English. With the number of different ethnic groups, Krio unites these groups with a common language. The citizens who are fluent in English are among the elite minority and often experience privileges such as economic opportunities that non-English speakers are excluded from. Other common indigenous languages used in the country are Mende, Temne, and Limba. As the official language, English is the only language used in education. It is reported that school children who speak indigenous languages on school premises are punished. Students who fail English classes are not granted admission into college.

{"abstract" : "The Sierra Leone Airports Authority (SLAA within the Ministry of Transport and Aviation) is the entity in charge of managing aviation transport and infrastructure in the country.The main airport is the Freetown – Lungi International Airport. Lungi is the main air access point into the country, and is the only airport capable of handling larger aircraft. The rest of the airports in Sierra Leone are provincial airstrips that were mostly built during the colonial era, and although they are functional, vast improvements are needed to bring them up to international standards.One of the main challenges of the Freetown – Lungi International Airport is its location. Although it serves Freetown, the airport is located on the other side of the Sierra Leone River. The commute between the airport and the city occurs mostly via ferry, taxi-boats or helicopter shuttles, as the access by road can take up to four hours. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, almost all commercial flights from Sierra Leone into Europe and other major cities in Africa were temporarily suspended.The improvement of the aviation infrastructure is a key factor for the revival of the tourist industry and the general economic development of Sierra Leone. Unfortunately, at Lungi and other smaller airports, a history of corruption has hindered much of the development process.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of airfieldTYPE-Classification in the geodatabaseICAO-International Civil Organization four letter airport location indicatorIATA-International Air Transport Association three letter airport location indicatorRUNWAY-Paved or unpaved runwayN_RUNWAYS-Number of runwaysR1_SURFACE-Runway surface type (Asphalt, Dirt, Grass, Concrete)R2_SURFACE-Second runway surface type (Asphalt, Dirt, Grass, Concrete)R_LENGTH-Length of runway (meters)R_WIDTH-Runway width (meters)USE-Use description (Regional, Local, International)CUSTOMS-Presence of customs (Yes or No)SPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location (1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)SOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from Wikimapia, GeoNames and sources such as Great Circle Mapper (GCmap) , Aircraft Charter World, the World Food Programme Logistics Capacity Assessment amongst others.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone enjoys vast surface water and groundwater resources. There are nine major river systems in Sierra Leone. These include: the Rokel/Seli, the Pampana/Jong, the Sewa, the Waanje and the coastal streams and creeks, all of which originate from within Sierra Leone. The country is also drained by the Moa River and the Great and Little Scarcies, which originate in Guinea, as well as by the Mano River, which originates in Liberia. Most of the country’s rivers are rocky and torrential in the uplands, but become wide estuaries bordered by mangrove swamps and floodplains in the lowlands near the Atlantic.In spite of the vast water resources, the availability of potable water or water for agricultural purposes is limited. National water supply coverage is estimated at only 22%. During the dry season, the usable water is insufficient to meet the country’s needs. Sierra Leone’s rivers are threatened by heavy pollution due to mining by-products and sewage.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameMAJ_NAME-Name of major watershed in which feature residesSUB_NAME-Name of sub-watershed in which feature residesTYPE-Classification in the geodatabaseHYDRO_DESC-Hydrology description typeSTRAHLER-Strahler stream-order number for attributeCOMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding the water featureSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoCollectionThe data in this feature class was developed from United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) HydroSHEDS data, which was originally created from orthorectified image mosaics collected during the February 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at three arc-second resolution. The result is a near- global stream network based on individual watersheds. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) further improved this data by attributing individual watersheds and sub-watersheds with names and Strahler stream-order numbering. The Strahler number indicates the number of tributaries which are attached to each node (i.e. if a node has no children, or tributaries attached to it, its Strahler number is one). This data was then clipped to the DigitalGlobe level zero administrative boundary for the country. It should be noted that these features were derived from image mosaics collected during a specific temporal range, and as such, may only reflect the status of water bodies present at that point in time. However, given the relatively detailed resolution and vast coverage of this data (from 60 degrees North to 56 South latitude), this dataset represents the best near-global coverage of surface waterbodies (in polyline form) available.Additional feature class information was generated utilizing data from OpenStreetMap (collected via BBBike) and DigitalGlobe Imagery. OpenStreetMap is a free worldwide map, created by crowd-sourcing. The use of OpenStreetMap data allowed for greater accuracy and number of Hydrology polylines included. Nonetheless the OpenStreetMap features do not contain Strahler, or watershed data.The data included herein have not been derived from a registered survey and should be considered approximate unless otherwise defined. While rigorous steps have been taken to ensure the quality of each dataset, DigitalGlobe is not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of data compiled from outside sources.Sources (HGIS)BBBike, \"Sierra Leone.\" November 2014.

{"abstract" : "It is reported that 60% to 80% of Sierra Leone citizens are Muslim and 10% to 20% are Christian. The discrepancy in an exact percent could be due in part to the integration of indigenous religious beliefs into both Islam and Christianity in the country. Also, the civil war which ended in 2002 caused a large portion of the population to move, making exact religious numbers difficult to formulate. Most Muslims are Sunni and Evangelical Christians are on the rise among the Christian minority. Religion does not have a role in either politics or ethnic identity. The country is very religiously tolerant, with Christians and Muslims known to intermarry. Although the majority of citizens in the country are either Muslim or Christian, indigenous belief systems are often incorporated by most people. This includes the belief in witches and juju (voodoo or magic). The belief in witchcraft is ingrained in West African society with believers in various ethnic groups, education levels, and economic conditions. Witchcraft and witch doctors are used to explain sickness and disease.The government respects religious freedom and as a result mosques, churches, and institutions for other religious minorities are found throughout the country. There are also no reports of abuse based on religious practice, belief, or affiliation. The highest concentration of religious institutions is located in Freetown, the capital and most populated city.

Needed funding for health initiatives in the past have come from the Asian Development Bank, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), United Nations Children’s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, and the World Bank. With all the health issues facing the country the Ministry of Health and Sanitation only received 8.2% of the government’s total budget in 2011. Along with the poor health care infrastructure the civil war also saw many hospitals looted, the acts having long reaching effects on the country. Sierra Leone has experienced many epidemics and other health events; the country has one of the highest prevalence of malaria in the world. Since May 2014 the country has also been dealing with an ever increasing Ebola outbreak. The health infrastructure in the country is already poor and being even more strained by the continuing Ebola epidemic.With many health issues facing the country, most medical facilities cannot support the demand. Hospitals and clinics across the country commonly face shortages of supplies and medication. There is also corruption in the healthcare system that is affecting medical facilities and their patients. Medication that is supposed to go to facilities under the free healthcare program established in the country, are often diverted for private sale. This is allowing people to make money of the illegal sale of drugs while denying facilities and patients they are intended to help.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone’s economy is primarily based on agriculture with over 50% of the populations engaged in this sector. The major food crops are rice, cassava, corn, millet, and peanuts while the main cash crops are coffee, cocoa, palm kernels, and palm oil. The country has a large mining industry presence that is predominantly controlled by foreign companies. The main minerals extracted are diamonds, iron ore, gold, bauxite, and titanium ore. There have also been a number of offshore oil discoveries made since 2009. The few manufactures in Sierra Leone are primarily for refined petroleum and basic consumer goods. The employment opportunities in Sierra Leone are insufficient to meet the country’s economic requirements as unemployment is at a staggering 28.4%.

{"abstract" : "Since the early 1930s when diamonds first began being extracted, the mineral industry of Sierra Leone has been an important part of the country’s economy. In addition to diamonds, large reserves of gold, bauxite, rutile, and iron ore are also present. Mining accounted for approximately 60 percent of the total export revenues in 2010. Further highlighting the importance of the mineral sector to the Sierra Leonean economy is the fact that close to 2/3 of the population works in this industry, primarily in small scale and artisanal operations.Though the 11-year civil war ended in 2002, its effects can still be felt throughout the economy. The extraction and trade of blood diamonds, diamonds used by rebels to buy weapons, left a distinct mark on the Sierra Leonean mining industry and as a result much needed infrastructure and transparency has been instituted and is still developing. To complement the diamond trade, the production of iron ore began in 2011. The iron ore industry is expected to account for 4.8 percentage points of the forecasted 11.3 percent annual GDP growth until 2013. Additionally, with the discovery of offshore oil reserves in 2009 and 2010, the country has avenues to further diversify their mineral revenues. Though oil production will not start until at least 2017, estimates range that 500-700 million barrels of high quality oil could be extracted. While the mineral sector is a major portion of the economy, it takes away major portions of the labor force at the expense of the agricultural sector in addition to making the economy vulnerable to external markets and trade shocks.

{"abstract" : "There is only one currently operational railway in Sierra Leone. The railway is narrow-gauged and privately owned by African Minerals (AML) for the purpose of transport of magnetite ore from the Tokolili mines to the Port of Pepel. This line was originally built in 1933 by the Sierra Leone Development Company, also for the purposes of iron ore transport. Operations had ceased during the 1990s due to the civil war. The line used to extend only up to the Marampa mine, but in 2009 AML rehabilitated the line and extended it to Tonkolili. The line has been operational since 2012.There are no passenger trains in Sierra Leone. Back in 1896, the Sierra Leone Government Railways were built, which used to connect Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Daru, and had a branch to Makeni. These railways were abandoned and finally closed in 1974. Most of these railways are now used as roads or remain dilapidated.There are reports of efforts to convert the existing railway to standard gauge, as well as to rehabilitate some of the abandoned railways, however, as with other infrastructure projects in Sierra Leone, the efforts are challenged by corruption, lack of funding and inadequate resources.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameNAME-Name of transportation pointTYPE1-Primary classification in the geodatabase TYPE2-Secondary classification in the geodatabaseCOMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding railwaysSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoCollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from OpenStreetMap.

{"abstract" : "The road network in Sierra Leone is a key factor for the continued economic development of the country as people and most commodities are transported by road. It is reported that there are over 11,000 km of roads, 8,000 km of which are part of the National Road System, with the rest making up local networks. The condition of the road network is poor with paved roads comprising only around 10% of the total.The principal roads in Freetown are generally paved, but narrow and with potholes. Roads outside of the capital are unpaved, but generally passable, except during the rainy season in which conditions become difficult and very unsafe.Road maintenance and development fall under the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA). Maintenance efforts are continually hindered by the lack of truck-overloading regulations.There are current government efforts to rehabilitate roads, especially in the rural provinces, but there continues to be a great gap between conditions in Freetown versus the rest of the country. Initiatives to improve roads have focused on privatization and on attracting foreign investment. Trans-national projects include plans to build the Trans-West African Coastal Highway, which would connect Sierra Leone with Guinea and Liberia, as well as with other West African countries. As with other infrastructure projects in Sierra Leone, challenges include lack of funding, corruption, and mismanagement.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameNAME-Name of the roadTYPE-Type of road COMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding the roadSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoCollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from OpenStreetMap.

Those who do go to school are often faced with poor curriculum and a lack of material. Overall the education system is extremely poor with nearly half of the population uneducated and illiterate. Those who continue onto secondary school typically begin at the age of 12. Urban schools and students are favored over rural populations where rural girls have the toughest time obtaining education. This is due to not only a lack of material and facilities but also cultural beliefs that urge against educating women. Those who also do not speak English are often discriminated against in the education system. As the official language, English is the only language used in education.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone’s educational attainment levels are poor at best. This lack of success is largely the result of a civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002, resulting in the demise of the country’s social and economic infrastructure. Education has made impressive strides following the end of the war, particularly primary education. The official age for entry into the primary education level is six years old. The official length of primary education is six years while secondary school is expected to last seven years. While enrollment in primary education is higher at 71.2%, the completion rate is significantly low at 4.11%. Enrollment in secondary education is much lower at 40%, with a completion rate of only 3.39%. Tertiary education enrollment and completion within Sierra Leone is largely insignificant.

{"abstract" : "Prior to the civil war in the 1990’s ethnic tension caused many rivalries between groups. This was common between the Temne, with their allies the Limba, and the Mende, with their allies the Sherbro, Kissi, and Gola groups. Even with this history of ethnic conflict it does not appear to be a significant factor that contributed to the civil war as the war focused on control of diamond mines. With the civil war over for more than a decade the country is relatively peaceful. There are no serious ethnic conflicts or rivalries. Limba – Limba populations are found in other West African countries although 90% reside in Sierra Leone. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the late nineteenth century. This is much later than their neighbors. To prevent too much Westernization, the Limba often send their children to Islamic schools. Mande – The Mande are a large ethnic group in West Africa that is comprised of many smaller groups. The Mande people speak a variety of Mande languages. Most practice agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade. They practice a patrilineal society having the eldest male serve as lineage head. With so many Mande groups spread over West Africa there is much variation among language and culture. Mel – The Mel within Sierra Leone are comprised of the Gola and the Kissi. Similar to other West Africa groups, the Gola participate in secret societies. The most important occurs around the age of puberty and these societies seek to socialize youth with Gola culture. The Kissi are increasingly becoming culturally influenced by the Mende people. Soso - The Soso were introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century and they are now overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, of the Maliki School. Many still perform ritual ceremonies from indigenous religions. They are often influenced by neighboring groups. Temne – The Temne are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country. While the capital of Freetown is home to many groups, the largest number of people belong to the Temne ethnicity. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century. Some Temne still practice indigenous religions or incorporate them into their practice of Islam. Similar to other groups in the country, the Temne also have secret socieites. The Temne use these socieites to learn about the Temne culture. Although many have convertered to Islam or Christianity, it is common to incorporate indigenous religious beliefs.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone Telecommunications Company Limited (SIERRATEL) is a limited liability company that is wholly owned by the Government of Sierra Leone. The company’s primary objective is to provide telecommunications services throughout the country at an affordable price.\n\nThe company has been progressively rebuilding its network infrastructure over the past years following the destruction of numerous equipment during the period of the civil war. In 2009, Sierratel added a brand new CDMA network to its landlines infrastructures which by then was almost in a defunct state. The new land service will be modernized to provide data capabilities as well as improved voice connection when commissioned. This will take Sierratel to a new high as the company will be the only provider of mobile and fixed land line service for both voice and data in the country.\n\nThe re-branded efforts of the company was rewarded in 2013 when, Sierratel won the prestigious ALL Walks OF LIFE (AWOL) award as the best telecommunications company. In like manner, the company was also awarded the best company in 2013 in the category of commerce as recognized by the Sierra Leone Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture.", "layer_username" : null, "reliability" : 100.0, "layer_originator" : "ngamaps.geointapps.org", "recent_reliability" : 100.0, "availability" : "Online", "min_x" : -13.23687, "min_y" : 7.76972, "title" : "Sierra Leone Cellular Towers", "domain_name" : "ngamaps.geointapps.org", "id" : "54", "location" : {"layerInfoPage": "/registry/layer/54/"}, "service_type" : "ESRI:ArcGIS:MapServer", "layer_category" : null, "max_x" : -10.94916, "max_y" : 8.88181, "layer_datetype" : "Detected", "layer_id" : "54", "bbox" : "ENVELOPE(-13.236870,-10.949160,8.881810,7.769720)", "last_status" : true, "is_public" : true, "layer_date" : "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z", "name" : "0", "layer_geoshape" : { "type" : "envelope", "coordinates" : [ [ -13.23687, 8.88181 ], [ -10.94916, 7.76972 ] ] }, "url" : "https://ngamaps.geointapps.org/arcgis/rest/services/Sierra_Leone/WWHD_Cellular_Towers_SLE/MapServer/?f=json", "type" : "Layer", "area" : 2.544139413899999, "srs" : [ "4326" ], "service_id" : "10"}

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone is not often affected by natural disasters aside from flooding; however, they are heavily affected by epidemics. Due to natural features and poor infrastructure, certain parts of the country are prone to flooding. The capital of Freetown, located in West Area Urban, is particularly inclined to floods. This is due to heavy rains, creating floods and landslides. The city also has a large amount of coastline and areas where rivers merge. The standing water creates an environment for swarms of mosquitoes, adding to the malaria issues. In 2013, Sierra Leone was labeled by World Health Organization as the country with the fifth highest prevalence of this disease. This report also stated that nearly one third of the population could be living with this malaria. This disease is also prevalent outside the capital, with poor sanitation found throughout the country.

{"abstract" : "While English is the official language, it is typically used for governmental, business, and media purposes. In day to day life most people in the country speak Krio, which is a style of Pidgin English or English-based creole language. Krio is the lingua franco for the country and the formal language for those who do not speak English. With the number of different ethnic groups, Krio unites these groups with a common language. The citizens who are fluent in English are among the elite minority and often experience privileges such as economic opportunities that non-English speakers are excluded from. Other common indigenous languages used in the country are Mende, Temne, and Limba. As the official language, English is the only language used in education. It is reported that school children who speak indigenous languages on school premises are punished. Students who fail English classes are not granted admission into college.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone enjoys vast surface water and groundwater resources. The country is drained by multiple rivers flowing North to South, most draining into the Atlantic ocean. The rivers are rocky and torrential in the uplands, but become wide wetland estuaries bordered by mangrove swamps and floodplains in the lowlands. There are various lakes and lagoons, most of which are located in the South. Lake Sonfon, is the most important freshwater lake. The lake is used for ceremonial and religious purposes by the local people, it is environmentally significant to the local fauna, and it has become a tourist attraction. The largest lagoons are the Magebi (aka Mabesi) and the Mape.In spite of the vast water resources, the availability of potable water or water for agricultural purposes is limited. National water supply coverage is estimated at only 22%. During the dry season, the usable water is insufficient to meet the country’s needs. Sierra Leone’s water bodies are threatened by heavy pollution due to mining by-products and sewage, as well as over drainage of wetlands.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameNAME-Name of the water areaTYPE-Classification in the geodatabaseHYDRO_DESC-Description of the occurrence of the water areaCOMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding the water featureSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoCollectionThe data in this feature class was developed from SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD), originally created by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

{"abstract" : "The National Power Authority (NPA) and Bo-Kenema Power Services (BKPS) are the only electricity distributors in Sierra Leone. The NPA and BKPS both fall under the Ministry of Energy and Power. One of the government’s main development focuses has been on the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project, which aims to establish an environmentally sustainable power source that is capable of meeting the necessary power supply. Electricity in Sierra Leone is described as sporadic and the majority of the electricity supply is restricted to the main cities of Freetown, Kenema, Bo, and Makeni. Biomass accounts for 80% of energy consumption in Sierra Leone, primarily consisting of wood fuel and charcoal. Imported petroleum products are the next largest energy source, which amounts to 13% of power supply. Electricity created from the national grid accounts for the remainder of the power supplied to the country. The electricity sector in Sierra Leone is extremely weak with an access rate of approximately 13.5%. Sierra Leone’s expanding economy coupled with increasing mining activities has served to expand the necessity for more energy generation. Meeting the supply demand has proven difficult and the problem is compounded by deterioration of existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of featureTYPE-Classification in the geodatabase (Generator, Substation, etc.)CITY-City location availableSPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location (1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)COMMENTS-Additional comments or notes regarding the electrical infrastructureSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was primarily generated utilizing data from Open Street Map.

{"abstract" : "Internet usage in Sierra Leone is extremely low with only around 1 percent of citizens having access. This low usage can in part be attributed to the telecommunication industry being neglected and damaged during the civil war. Coupled with a poor internet infrastructure, prices are extremely high and deter many users. The country recently connected to the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) Submarine Cable, in an attempt to update their infrastructure and service. Many people complain that the service had not improved. In addition to high prices and poor infrastructure, another hindrance for more internet users is the lack of access to electricity. Only 13.5 percent of the population has access to electricity. The country has many separate issues playing into the low internet rates, and will have to make progress in all of them to make a difference. The majority of internet cafes are found in the capital city of Freetown. This area not only hosts the largest population in the country but also offers the highest access to electricity. A few internet cafes are found outside of the capital although rural communities do not have the resources for an internet café.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone’s small power sector is owned and operated by the state-run, vertically integrated National Power Authority. Access to electricity is largely confined to the capital, Freetown, and the surrounding area. The 2011 National Electricity Act mandated the creation of separate electric service entities. One for the generation and transmission of electricity, and one for the distribution and supply of electricity. However, as of the second quarter of 2014, neither had yet been established. In the absence of a regulator, the Ministry of Energy has oversight of the sector. Three out of five households in Sierra Leone get drinking water from an improved source of water with a 59.5% access rate. A higher proportion of urban households (89%) have an improved source of water compared with rural households (48%). Almost 40% of households get their drinking water from a non-improved source. There is a 57.1% access rate to improved sanitation; however, only 10% of households use an improved toilet facility that is not shared with other households.

{"abstract" : "While English is the official language, it is typically used for governmental, business, and media purposes. In day to day life most people in the country speak Krio, which is a style of Pidgin English or English-based creole language. Krio is the lingua franco for the country and the formal language for those who do not speak English. With the number of different ethnic groups, Krio unites these groups with a common language. The citizens who are fluent in English are among the elite minority and often experience privileges such as economic opportunities that non-English speakers are excluded from. Other common indigenous languages used in the country are Mende, Temne, and Limba. As the official language, English is the only language used in education. It is reported that school children who speak indigenous languages on school premises are punished. Students who fail English classes are not granted admission into college.

The major food crops are rice, cassava, corn, millet, and peanuts while the main cash crops are coffee, cocoa, palm kernels, and palm oil. The country has a large mining industry presence that is predominantly controlled by foreign companies. The main minerals extracted are diamonds, iron ore, gold, bauxite, and titanium ore. There have also been a number of offshore oil discoveries made since 2009. The few manufactures in Sierra Leone are primarily for refined petroleum and basic consumer goods.

{"abstract" : "Public transportation in Sierra Leone is a rather unregulated business, with no comprehensive country-wide agenda. Most public transport appears to be provided by private entities. TaxiIn the larger towns, taxi service is rather reliable and occurs along predetermined routes. Most common is the use of Motorbike taxis, also known as Ocadas, which travel both within and across neighboring towns.BusMinibuses, known as Poda-Podas are the most common means of transport between towns. There are also Government Bus Routes and private Coach Buses, but these only connect the cities of Freetown, Bo and Kenema. Water transportIn Freetown, the use of water-based transportation is especially important for travel to and from the Lungi International Airport. The airport is located on the opposite side of the Sierra Leone River and at a distance of 3-4 hours if accessed by road, so options such as taxi-boat and ferries are the preferred modes of transport. Ferries are also used to connect Freetown to Pepel, Bonthe, and other smaller ports in the country.Air TransportHelicopter shuttles are available in Freetown, as another means – albeit more expensive – to connect to the Lungi International Airport, which is the only airport that meets international standards in the country. There are smaller airfields throughout some of the major towns.RailThere is currently no public rail transport in Sierra Leone. The previously existing Government Railways have been abandoned since the 1970’s, and the one existing railway in the country is used privately for the purpose of cargo transport.Crime-wise, transport across the country is generally safe. However, due to the poor conditions of most of the road network, the difficult weather during the rainy season, and the lack of driving regulations, the accident rate is high, especially on rural roads. Similarly, water-transport can be unsafe as most ferries and taxi-boats have limited safety equipment and navigational lights, and the emergency response system is uncoordinated and inefficient.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of transportation pointTYPE1-Primary classification in the geodatabase TYPE2-Secondary classification in the geodatabaseCITY-City location availableSPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location (1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)COMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding public transportation SOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from OpenStreetMap, GeoNames, and Wikimapia.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone is a source and destination country for illegal trafficking operations. Sierra Leone retains a high potential for becoming an epicenter for illegal trafficking. This is plausible given the end of a relatively recent civil war of which the economy and populace is still recovering from, and the recent outbreak of Ebola. The government’s resources are already strained and funding anti-trafficking measures is likely to be somewhat disregarded in the face of more pressing concerns. Some of the most notable smuggling concerns within Sierra Leone are narcotics, diamonds, and humans. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) identified Sierra Leone as a major gateway in West Africa for cocaine trafficking. One of the most notable examples of trafficking occurred in 2008 when a private aircraft landed at Lungi International Airport carrying 700 kg of cocaine. A 2011 UNODC survey conducted among secondary school students and street children in Freetown reported that 65% of young people were using cannabis, 6.8% using cocaine, and 5.6% using heroin. These numbers provide evidence of a significant presence of narcotics and therefore illicit trafficking activity within the country and its capital. One of the country’s greatest economic and political problems dating back before it gained independence is diamond smuggling. Its diamond fields cover over 7,700 square miles, namely located in the southeastern and eastern parts, amounting to almost a quarter of the country. The primary diamond production areas are concentrated in the districts of Kono and Kenema, primarily in the drainage areas of the Baffin, Sewa, Woa, Mano, and Moa Rivers. Liberia has served as the traditional smuggling route for trafficking diamonds out of Sierra Leone. In addition to diamond smuggling, the country is also a source and destination country for forced labor and sex trafficking. The U.S. Department of State reports that victims largely come from rural provinces and are recruited to urban and mining centers for prostitution, domestic service, and forced labor in artisanal diamond and granite mining, street crime, begging, and other forms of forced labor.

{"abstract" : "There is only one currently operational railway in Sierra Leone. The railway is narrow-gauged and privately owned by African Minerals (AML) for the purpose of transport of magnetite ore from the Tokolili mines to the Port of Pepel. This line was originally built in 1933 by the Sierra Leone Development Company, also for the purposes of iron ore transport. Operations had ceased during the 1990s due to the civil war. The line used to extend only up to the Marampa mine, but in 2009 AML rehabilitated the line and extended it to Tonkolili. The line has been operational since 2012. There are no passenger trains in Sierra Leone. Back in 1896, the Sierra Leone Government Railways were built, which used to connect Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Daru, and had a branch to Makeni. These railways were abandoned and finally closed in 1974. Most of these railways are now used as roads or remain dilapidated.The Sierra Leone National Railway Museum, located in Freetown, houses a collection of the British-built trains that used to operate within Sierra Leone in the beginning of the Twentieth Century.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of public security establishmentTYPE-Classification in the geodatabase CITY-City location availableSPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location (1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)COMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding the public security establishmentSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from OpenStreetMap and GeoNames.

{"abstract" : "The DigitalGlobe Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (DGMPI) is an in-house multi-dimensional measurement that depicts poverty on a subnational level. The index takes a weighted-average approach across five different \"factors\" viewed as directly contributing to human poverty. Where traditional measures of poverty as officially reported by states typically consist only of income information, the DGMPI examines data on wealth inequality, human rights, state corruption, human security, health and sanitation, education, and material assets. Each of 16 poverty \"indicators\" is coded such that the appropriate scalar variable is converted into a binary coding scheme. This coding scheme is then averaged within each \"factor,\" the results of which are then equal-weight averaged against each other. The resulting scalar value is the administrative unit’s MDPI score, where 0.00 represents least impoverishment and 1.00 represents most impoverishment. Please see the attached document for specific details on the DGMPI.Sierra Leone is ranked among the world’s most impoverished countries, largely the product of an 11 year civil war that formally ended in 2002, and decades of economic decline. Poverty is common as over 60% of the population lives on less than US $1.25 a day. Contributing to widespread poverty are unemployment and illiteracy. Unemployment is at a rate of approximately 28.4%, while illiteracy is 53.62%.

{"abstract" : "Dams are grouped into the following types; Irrigation, Electricity, and Water Supply.Sierra Leone enjoys abundant water resources when compared to other West African countries. However, water availability is seasonal, and the insufficient number of dams and general infrastructure impede adequate water supply to the growing population.The main water supply reservoir in Sierra Leone is the Guma Dam, which supplies Freetown with an estimated 83 million liters of water per day. The dam is insufficient to provide for the present urban population, with the poorest areas of the city having little to no access to the piped water. The rest of the country relies mostly on surface waters such as rivers and ponds for their access to water, with only 1% of the rural population having access to piped water. As far as dams used for electricity, the Bumbuna Dam, was opened on November 2009 as the country’s first hydro-power dam. Bumbuna provides electricity to Freetown, and has a capacity of 50 MW. However, due to the dilapidated conditions of the electrical network, it is estimated that the dam operates at only half of its capacity.There are current efforts by the government to improve both the water supply and electrical infrastructure by decentralizing, and encouraging private investment. There are reports indicating several small hydro electrical dams are being built around the country by international economic interests or by humanitarian relief agencies. There are also projects to construct an additional water supply dam near Freetown, however, the projects are challenged by lack of funding and corruption.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of the damTYPE-Classification in the geodatabase (Irrigation, Water Supply, Electricity)CITY-City location availableRIVER-Water body which dam is located on (if applicable)YR_OPER-Year dam became operational or last upgrades were completedHEIGHT-Height of dam in metersCAPACITY-Capacity of reservoir behind dam in millions of cubic metersSPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location(1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)COMMENTS-Comments or notes regarding the damSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was generated utilizing data from the United Nation’s FAO Aquastat database, GeoNames, and multiple free-access online databases and news sources.

There have been improvements for these freedoms however the Public Order Act 1965 allows prison time for libel and publishing false news. There have been instances where people were charged for libel even though they could prove their information was true.

Radio is the most used media and there are radio towers throughout the country. While access to electricity is an issue in the country coupled with rampant poverty, radio towers are relatively easy to have in rural areas.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone is a country that has been plagued with infighting as tensions still exist following the civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002. In March 1991 the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the forces of Charles Taylor’s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) attempted to oust the government of Joseph Momoh. One of the more interesting aspects of this civil war was that it was largely fought by young teenage rebels. Over 50,000 people died during the civil war, lending to long lasting sentiments that continue to shape the nature of conflict within the country. The RUF lasted as a formal political party until 2007 and its remaining senior leaders were charged for war crimes in 2009. Sierra Leones most recent conflict is characterized largely by riots and protesting. The OSAC reports that there has been a sharp incline in the number of gangs and factions in Freetown over the past 6 years, which has served to increase crime within the capital. These gangs consist of unemployed youth who align according to geographic, ethnic/tribal similarities or according to pop music preferences (i.e. rival local hip-hop artists); however, most gang activity is confined to eastern Freetown. The nightclubs along Aberdeen Road and Lumley Beach Road are reported to be among the most dangerous in the capital as the occurrence of burglary, prostitution, drug sales, and bar fights are popular.

{"abstract" : "Power Plants are broken down into the following types: Coal, Gas, Hydroelectricity, Oil, and Wind.The National Power Authority (NPA) and Bo-Kenema Power Services (BKPS) are the only electricity distributors in Sierra Leone. The NPA and BKPS both fall under the Ministry of Energy and Power. One of the government’s main development focuses has been on the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project, which aims to establish an environmentally sustainable power source that is capable of meeting the necessary power supply. Electricity in Sierra Leone is described as sporadic and the majority of the electricity supply is restricted to the main cities of Freetown, Kenema, Bo, and Makeni. The Kingtom Power Station in Western Area is the main power generating station to the country. Biomass accounts for 80% of energy consumption in Sierra Leone, primarily consisting of wood fuel and charcoal. Imported petroleum products are the next largest energy source, which amounts to 13% of power supply. Electricity created from the national grid accounts for the remainder of the power supplied to the country. The electricity sector in Sierra Leone is extremely weak with an access rate of approximately 13.5%. Sierra Leone’s expanding economy coupled with increasing mining activities has served to expand the necessity for more energy generation. Meeting the supply demand has proven difficult and the problem is compounded by deterioration of existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / nameNAME-Name of featureTYPE-Classification in the geodatabase (Hydroelectricity, Gas, Oil, etc.)CITY-City in which feature resides or is closest toNUM_GEN-Number of generators installed at plantTOT_CAP_MW-Total capacity of plant in megawattsOP_STATUS-Operational status of plant (Operational, Under Construction, etc.)OP_CON-Operational control of plantSPA_ACC-Spatial accuracy of site location (1 – high, 2 – medium, 3 – low)CONF_IMAGE-DG imagery confirmation (Confirmed, Assessed, Reported, Unconfirmed)COMMENTS-Notes regarding power plantSOURCE_DT-Source one creation dateSOURCE-Source oneSOURCE2_DT-Source two creation dateSOURCE2-Source twoImgDate-Date of imageSatName-Name of satellite that collected imagefeatureID-DG image catalog identification codeDigitalGlobe Satellite NamesGE01 – GeoEye 01 QB02 – QuickBird WV01 – WorldView 01 WV02 – WorldView 02 WV03 – WorldView 03 CollectionThe feature class was primarily generated utilizing data from Enipedia and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

Religious beliefs and practices are very present in daily life and there are many historic sights, relics, and monuments.

{"abstract" : "The public security network in Sierra Leone is strained due to the recent Ebola crisis. The Sierra Leone Police (SLP) is responsible for enforcing the law within the country. Each administrative district contains a local unit commander. The SLP has been reported as one of the most corrupt institutions within the country. A public perception survey report published by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) rated the police as 85% corrupt in 2008. The ACC again named the police as the most corrupt institution in the 2013 public perception survey. SLP officers are often bribed as their salaries are extremely low. They are particularly infamous for taking bribes from commercial transport drivers and other offenders. Prior to 2012 elections police constables were reportedly being paid less than US $100 a month, which was supplemented with a bag of rice. As of the beginning of 2014, public workers’ salaries were increased by the government and police officers are now receiving more than US $100 a month. The fire fighting force in Sierra Leone is hampered by water shortages and a scarce number of hydrants. Reports indicate that electrical fires are common due to poor wiring and fluctuations in the electrical current supply. During 2013’s dry season, the fire force covered the entirety of Freetown with only one fully functional fire engine following the breakdown of its other two. The fire force has limited resources and is poorly equipped, which is evident in that they fight fires without any breathing apparatus.

{"abstract" : "Prior to the civil war in the 1990’s ethnic tension caused many rivalries between groups. This was common between the Temne, with their allies the Limba, and the Mende, with their allies the Sherbro, Kissi, and Gola groups. Even with this history of ethnic conflict it does not appear to be a significant factor that contributed to the civil war as the war focused on control of diamond mines. With the civil war over for more than a decade the country is relatively peaceful. There are no serious ethnic conflicts or rivalries. Limba – Limba populations are found in other West African countries although 90% reside in Sierra Leone. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the late nineteenth century. This is much later than their neighbors. To prevent too much Westernization, the Limba often send their children to Islamic schools. Mande – The Mande are a large ethnic group in West Africa that is comprised of many smaller groups. The Mande people speak a variety of Mande languages. Most practice agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade. They practice a patrilineal society having the eldest male serve as lineage head. With so many Mande groups spread over West Africa there is much variation among language and culture. Mel – The Mel within Sierra Leone are comprised of the Gola and the Kissi. Similar to other West Africa groups, the Gola participate in secret societies. The most important occurs around the age of puberty and these societies seek to socialize youth with Gola culture. The Kissi are increasingly becoming culturally influenced by the Mende people. Soso - The Soso were introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century and they are now overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, of the Maliki School. Many still perform ritual ceremonies from indigenous religions. They are often influenced by neighboring groups. Temne – The Temne are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country. While the capital of Freetown is home to many groups, the largest number of people belong to the Temne ethnicity. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century. Some Temne still practice indigenous religions or incorporate them into their practice of Islam. Similar to other groups in the country, the Temne also have secret socieites. The Temne use these socieites to learn about the Temne culture. Although many have convertered to Islam or Christianity, it is common to incorporate indigenous religious beliefs.

The information was then processed through DigitalGlobe’s AnthropMapper program to generate more accurate ethnic coverage boundaries. Anthromapper uses geographical terrain features, combined with a watershed model, to predict the likely extent of ethnic and linguistic influence.Metadata and data pertaining to the feature class was collected from the review of Murdock’s Map of Africa (1959) in conjunction with information from anthropological research pertaining to ethnicity in northern Africa. While efforts were made to secure the accuracy of the geographic location of existing ethnicities, many are transient in nature and continue to migrate. Further, it should be stressed that ethnic groups listed represent the prominent people groups in Sierra Leone; however, numerous subgroups may exist below this tier. The data included herein have not been derived from a registered survey and should be considered approximate unless otherwise defined. While rigorous steps have been taken to ensure the quality of each dataset, DigitalGlobe is not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of data compiled from outside sources.Sources (HGIS)Anthromapper.

{"abstract" : "There are very few ports in Sierra Leone.The Port of Freetown is the most important entry gate in the country for commerce and trade. The port is located in one of the largest natural harbors in Africa, and it is the only deep water port capable of handling large cargo vessels. The port can handle up to 7 million tons of cargo annually, and total revenue is estimated at $11 million USD per year, a most significant economic engine of the Sierra Leone economy. Near the Port of Freetown is the Kissy Oil Terminal, which is the only oil terminal in the country, and is the main entry point for all the oil products imported into the country.The Port of Pepel is mostly used and managed privately by African Minerals Limited (AML), for the purpose of shipping iron ore mined within the country. The Port of Bonthe (Sherbro Islands) was built during the colonial times, but has fallen into disuse and is mostly now used for the shipment of small agricultural cargo.The Sierra Leone Port Authority (SLPA) within the Ministry of Trade and Tourism is in charge of the management and infrastructure development of the ports.The continued economic development of Sierra Leone depends largely in the improvement of its ports, especially the Port of Freetown. With foreign aid and privatization strategies, infrastructure developments and advances in management have occurred in recent years, but the facilities remain inadequate for international standards. Opportunities for becoming a major shipping hub can be exploited due the strategic location of Freetown as a mid-way point of ships traveling to and from Asia, Europe and North America, via South Atlantic Ocean Routes.Attribute Table Field DescriptionsISO3-International Organization for Standardization 3-digit country codeADM0_NAME-Administration level zero identification / nameADM1_NAME-Administration level one identification / nameADM2_NAME-Administration level two identification / nameADM3_NAME-Administration level three identification / nameADM4_NAME-Administration level four identification / namePORT_NAME-Name of portCITY-City location availableHARBORSIZE-The classification of harbor size is based on area, facilities, and wharf spaceHARBORTYPE-Principal water area of the portSHELTER-Shelter afforded from wind, sea, and swell, refers to the area where normal port operations are conducted, usually the wharf areaENTRY_TIDE-Tide restricting the entrance of vesselsENTRYSWELL-Swell restricting the entrance of vesselsENTRY_ICE-Ice restricting the entrance of vesselsENTRYOTHER-Any other natural factor restricting the entrance of a vesselOVERHD_LIM-Entry is shown only to indicate that bridge and overhead power cables existCHAN_DEPTH-Controlling depth of the principal or deepest channel at chart datum is given in meters.

{"abstract" : "Prior to the civil war in the 1990’s ethnic tension caused many rivalries between groups. This was common between the Temne, with their allies the Limba, and the Mende, with their allies the Sherbro, Kissi, and Gola groups. Even with this history of ethnic conflict it does not appear to be a significant factor that contributed to the civil war as the war focused on control of diamond mines. With the civil war over for more than a decade the country is relatively peaceful. There are no serious ethnic conflicts or rivalries. Limba – Limba populations are found in other West African countries although 90% reside in Sierra Leone. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the late nineteenth century. This is much later than their neighbors. To prevent too much Westernization, the Limba often send their children to Islamic schools. Mande – The Mande are a large ethnic group in West Africa that is comprised of many smaller groups. The Mande people speak a variety of Mande languages. Most practice agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade. They practice a patrilineal society having the eldest male serve as lineage head. With so many Mande groups spread over West Africa there is much variation among language and culture. Mel – The Mel within Sierra Leone are comprised of the Gola and the Kissi. Similar to other West Africa groups, the Gola participate in secret societies. The most important occurs around the age of puberty and these societies seek to socialize youth with Gola culture. The Kissi are increasingly becoming culturally influenced by the Mende people. Soso - The Soso were introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century and they are now overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, of the Maliki School. Many still perform ritual ceremonies from indigenous religions. They are often influenced by neighboring groups. Temne – The Temne are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country. While the capital of Freetown is home to many groups, the largest number of people belong to the Temne ethnicity. The majority are Muslim, having been introduced to Islam in the seventeenth century. Some Temne still practice indigenous religions or incorporate them into their practice of Islam. Similar to other groups in the country, the Temne also have secret socieites. The Temne use these socieites to learn about the Temne culture. Although many have convertered to Islam or Christianity, it is common to incorporate indigenous religious beliefs.

The information was then processed through DigitalGlobe’s AnthropMapper program to generate more accurate ethnic coverage boundaries. Anthromapper uses geographical terrain features, combined with a watershed model, to predict the likely extent of ethnic and linguistic influence.Metadata and data pertaining to the feature class was collected from the review of Murdock’s Map of Africa (1959) in conjunction with information from anthropological research pertaining to ethnicity in northern Africa. While efforts were made to secure the accuracy of the geographic location of existing ethnicities, many are transient in nature and continue to migrate. Further, it should be stressed that ethnic groups listed represent the prominent people groups in Sierra Leone; however, numerous subgroups may exist below this tier.

Each of 16 poverty \"indicators\" is coded such that the appropriate scalar variable is converted into a binary coding scheme. This coding scheme is then averaged within each \"factor,\" the results of which are then equal-weight averaged against each other.

Poverty is common as over 60% of the population lives on less than US $1.25 a day. Contributing to widespread poverty are unemployment and illiteracy. Unemployment is at a rate of approximately 28.4%, while illiteracy is 53.62%.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone’s educational attainment levels are poor at best. This lack of success is largely the result of a civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002, resulting in the demise of the country’s social and economic infrastructure. Education has made impressive strides following the end of the war, particularly primary education. The official age for entry into the primary education level is six years old. The official length of primary education is six years while secondary school is expected to last seven years. While enrollment in primary education is higher at 71.2%, the completion rate is significantly low at 4.11%. Enrollment in secondary education is much lower at 40%, with a completion rate of only 3.39%. Tertiary education enrollment and completion within Sierra Leone is largely insignificant. The total literacy rate in Sierra Leone is 46.38%. Without increased attention towards education in Sierra Leone, literacy rates will continue to be substantially low.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone’s small power sector is owned and operated by the state-run, vertically integrated National Power Authority. Access to electricity is largely confined to the capital, Freetown, and the surrounding area. The 2011 National Electricity Act mandated the creation of separate electric service entities. One for the generation and transmission of electricity, and one for the distribution and supply of electricity. However, as of the second quarter of 2014, neither had yet been established. In the absence of a regulator, the Ministry of Energy has oversight of the sector. Three out of five households in Sierra Leone get drinking water from an improved source of water with a 59.5% access rate. A higher proportion of urban households (89%) have an improved source of water compared with rural households (48%). Almost 40% of households get their drinking water from a non-improved source. There is a 57.1% access rate to improved sanitation; however, only 10% of households use an improved toilet facility that is not shared with other households.

{"abstract" : "Sierra Leone is one of the smallest countries in West Africa with a total land area of 72,325 km2, of which approximately 75 percent is adequate for crop production. The country has four distinct regions comprised of the coastal plains, lowlands, the interior plateau, and the Freetown peninsula. The coastal plain is comprised of beaches, swamps, and flood plains. The lowland comprises the majority of the country and is largely comprised of swamp. The interior plateau covers the north-eastern portion of the country and is marked by higher elevations. The Freetown peninsula is primarily comprised of three parallel highland ranges. Though once covered in dense forests, estimates have stated that close to 70 percent of its forest has been lost due to human action. The country has an extremely diverse terrain that can be exploited in a number of ways from tourism to further resource extraction.
